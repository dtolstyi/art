# Overview  
__ART: Accommodation Review Template__ is a template designed to make reviews of your stays at AirBnB, Booking.com, Hotels.com, Agoda or any other website easy, structured and useful for other travelers.  

The problem with most reviews is that they describe emotions instead of the facts that can be useful for others. For sure, emotions are very good and valuable as well but they won't help much for people trying to understand if Wi-Fi connection is good enough to be able to work from the location or if the location is easily reachable and quiet enough for sleeping / relaxing.  

This template is aimed to solve the issue of emotional reviews by adding structure to them, so all of the main aspects of the accommodation are reviewed and they can be easily found and used by other travelers.

# How to use template  
The template itself is just a set of categories to be reviewed. If there are some categories that are not relevant for your accommodation (e.g. there's no kitchen) you can just remove this section from the review rather than leaving it empty. The same way, if there are some missing categories, you can freely add them where you feel they logically fit (currently, categories are sorted in the order of appearance during your trip).   
  
It's a good idea to start review with the __overview__ section containing several phrases so other travelers can understand your feelings about this accommodation and overall experience and then you can review every category from the template.   
  
The main idea when filling the categories is that this information is going to be read by other travelers and you need to think like: 'What should I write that this is useful for others?' or 'What information I would like to see in this category so it could help me to make a decision on taking this accomodation or not?'   
As far as this template should be suitable for any type of accommodation (room, apartment, house, ...) some sections naming has multiple types listed (e.g. `Apartment / Room Number`). This section name can be changed according to what suits the best your situation by leaving either `Apartment Number` or `Room Number` or something that you think fits more (e.g. `Villa Name`).

# Future Plans  
A small web page needs to be created to automatically generate fields for each category, which people can fill with the information and the final review text is generated for the user. Finally, the text can be copied into the review page of accommodation service.
